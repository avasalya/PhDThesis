	\caption{All participants regression fits in the human co-worker condition. Examples of linear regression fits obtained between the participant's {\it htp} change between the together and alone conditions (ordinates), as a function of co-worker's {\it htp}s (abscissa). The positive slopes show that the human co-worker's performance {\it htp} (hence frequency) influenced the human participants.}

\begin{sidewaysfigure}[hpt]
	\centering{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/c3-supp/S1_Fig}}
	\caption{All participants regression fits in the robot co-worker condition. Note that most participant plots show a positive slope indicating that the robot co-worker's performance {\it htp} (hence frequency) influenced the human participants.}
	\label{S1_Fig}
\end{sidewaysfigure}


\begin{sidewaysfigure}[hpt]
	\centering{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/c3-supp/S3_Fig}}
	\caption{All participants regression fits in the robot covered co-worker condition. Note that there is no trend in slopes across participant ---the slopes were in fact observed to be zero across participants (Fig.~\ref{fig:slope_allcond}), indicating that the participant's {\it htp}s were not affected in the robot covered co-worker condition.}

\begin{figure}[hpt]
	\centering{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/c3-supp/S4_Fig}}
	\caption{All participants regression fits in the human covered co-worker condition. Like in~\ref{S3_Fig}, the slopes were observed to be zero across participants (Fig.~\ref{fig:slope_allcond}), indicating that  the participant's {\it htp}s were not affected in the human covered co-worker condition}

\begin{sidewaysfigure}[hpt]
	\centering{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/c3-supp/S5_Fig}}
	\caption{All participants regression fits in the robot non-biol co-worker condition. The plots again show that the participant's {\it htp}s were not affected in the robot non-biol co-worker condition.}

\begin{sidewaysfigure}[hpt]
	\centering{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/c3-supp/S6_Fig}}
	\caption{All participants regression fits in the robot indus co-worker condition. Like in ~\ref{S3_Fig} to ~\ref{S5_Fig}, we observed no effect in the participants in the robot indus co-worker condition.}
