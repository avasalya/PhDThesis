\chapter{Introduction}

This thesis work is about the interactions between human and humanoid robot as co-workers in the industrial scenarios. By interactions, we started with a non-physical human-robot interaction based on a industrially inspired \textit{Pick-n-Place} task example and try to move towards physical human-robot interactions with an example of human humanoid dual arm bi-directional object handover.
