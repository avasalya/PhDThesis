\section*{\huge Abstract}
Multiple studies have shown that the mere observation of movements by a robot can affect an observing human's movement; effects referred to as motor contagions. However, previous studies have either analyzed motor contagions induced during (which we call \emph{on-line} contagions), or induced after (\emph{off-line} contagions) observation of the robot, but never both together. It thus remains unclear whether and how these two contagions differ from each other. Here, in an empirical industrial co-worker setting, we examine the differences in the off-line and on-line contagions induced in participants by the observation of the same movements performed by a human, or a humanoid robot co-worker. We observed that while the off-line contagions predominantly affect the participant's movement velocity, the on-line contagions affect their movement frequency. Furthermore, the off-line contagions were prominent after observing another human, while the on-line contagions were equally strong with either a human or a humanoid co-worker. These results suggest that actions by a humanoid robot can induce distinct effects on human behaviors, during and after observation.  	


Does the presence of a robot co-worker influence the performance of humans around it? Studies of motor contagions during human-robot interactions have examined either how the observation of a robot affects a human's movement velocity, or how it affects the human's movement variance, but never both together. Performance however, has to be measured considering both task speed (or frequency) as well as task accuracy. Here we examine an empirical repetitive industrial task in which a human participant and a humanoid robot work near each other. We systematically varied the robot behavior, and observed whether and how the performance of a human participant is affected by the presence of the robot. To investigate the effect of physical form, we added conditions where the robot co-worker torso and head were covered, and only the moving arm was visible to the human participants. Finally, we compared these behaviors with a human co-worker, and examined how the observed behavioral affects scale with experience of robots. Our results show that human task frequency, but not task accuracy, is affected by the observation of a humanoid robot co-worker, provided the robot's head and torso are visible.%\ldots
